## UberStrok
### **WARNING! DO NOT USE THE MASTER BRANCH!** 
The master branch lacks a lot of features, and is hard to get working in the first place!<br>
Use the [v0.1.0-alpha branch](https://github.com/SirAnuse/uberstrok/tree/v0.1.0-alpha) instead!<br>
Despite the fact it *sounds* older, it is far more feature rich, but instead comes with a spaghetti-laden codebase.
**Until the abstraction (being done in the master branch) is complete, use the alpha branch. You do NOT want to use the master branch in its' current state.**

An effort to write a shitty UberStrike back-end implementation intended for educational purposes.

#### Note
This is the `master` branch where "development" takes place, check the other branches for "stable" builds.

### Setting Up
Check [issue #9](https://github.com/FICTURE7/uberstrok/issues/9) & [#13](https://github.com/FICTURE7/uberstrok/issues/13) for some instructions.

### FAQ

#### Why?
I've never written realtime servers for FPS before and to learn how to work with the Photon SDK. But
mostly to be able to play this game again with some friends for the sake of nostalgia.

And because [dropshot](https://www.github.com/festivaldev/dropshot) seem to be inactive, so I decided
to continue on my own.

#### Does multiplayer work?
Yes, however only CuberStrike in Team Deathmatch mode is supported. 

It is highly recommended you use the [v0.1.0-alpha branch](https://github.com/SirAnuse/uberstrok/tree/v0.1.0-alpha) for gameplay purposes, as it contains configurations for all maps, and support for Deathmatch.
 
#### Are features missing?
Yes.

#### 'Bugs'
Its not a bug, its a feature, but if you're not happy with it, you can still create a new issue 
about the feature, maybe I will polish it up. Or you could send a pull request with the polished feature.
